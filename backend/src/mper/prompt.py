Analyze the new user input and identify which worker agent(s) need to be re-run based on the requested change.
Consult the previous supervisor history to determine the order in which the worker agents were called in the first run.
Starting from the worker agent that needs to be re-run based on the user's input, call the appropriate worker agents in the order they were called in the first run. For example, if the user requested a change in the outlier detection method, start by calling the outlier detection worker agent with the updated method.
After each worker agent completes its task, review the output and determine which worker agent to call next based on the previous supervisor history and the dependencies between the worker agents.
Continue calling the worker agents in the appropriate order until all the necessary steps have been re-run to accommodate the user's updated request.
Once all the required worker agents have been re-run, provide a summary of the changes made and the updated forecasting results to the user.
